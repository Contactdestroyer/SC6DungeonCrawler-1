/*
Sprites: Multiple small sprites for full armor sets.(Not individual armor pieces.) And no shields.
Need to look like wizard robes, light armor, and heavy armor.

/*
This class is going to need a constructor that has two parameters. One to determine
armor type(Robe, Leather, Metal). And one to assign armor points. Then we will want variables called
something like "armorPT" and "Evasiveness". The constructor will need an if statement that assigns
"Evasiveness" a value based on the armor type(~100 if light, ~50 if robes, ~0 if heavy).
